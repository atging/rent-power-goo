Reads in 2 data files of apartment rents &amp; makes statistics from them

Problem:
There are two CSV files.  The file named "market_rents.csv" can be used to determine the average previous market_rent, 
new lease market_rent price for a given unit type each month.  Inside "prospect_events.csv" is a series of events that 
were recorded for each prospect looking at an apartment.

Exercise 1: Develop an algorithm that can be used to rank the overall performance of a Leasing Agent on a monthly basis.  
Key performance metrics for an Agent would be closing time, increase in market rent, and overall closing rate.

Exercise 2: Develop an algorithm that can be used to identify the best marketing source each quarter based on the cost 
structure outlined below:

Apartment Guide = $495 per month, flat rate
Apartments.com = $295 per signed lease
Rent.com = $595 or 50% per lease signed, whichever is higher.
For Rent = $195 monthly, plus $25 per lead.
Craigslist = Free!
Resident Referral = $500 per signed lease
